# 2012-Presidential-Election-Funds-Tracker

This project deals with the analysis if the data shared by Federal High Commission for 2012 Presidential Election Donation. The dataset provided details for three candidates, namely - Gary Johnson, Buddy Roemer and Jill Stein. All the files have to be cleaned, grouped, merged and sorted. A trend was identified using the state-wise grpah plt technique. On the basis of occupation based donation, a co-relation was established between the donations received for all the candidates.
